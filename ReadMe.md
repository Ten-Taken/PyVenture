About
---------------

I'm currently teaching myself Python syntax and the django web framework. This repository will host some of the small
programs I build while getting myself up to speed with both.

Standalone
-----------------

I'm simply listing standalone programs in the root directory here:


**Guessing Game**  
	guess.py contains an IDLE / Shell program where the user guesses a random number
	between 1 and 100.

**Word Game**  
	wordGame.py is a word guessing game (similar to hangman).  The user is out after
	three strikes.


django_project
----------------------

In this directory I'm following along with a pluralsight course taught by Reindert-Jan Ekker (https://nl.linkedin.com/in/rjekker).

Django and package dependencies are set up in a virtual environment.

It's important to note that the django_project directory is the environment
level, and the actual django project is under 'testProject'

The course is taught using Django 1.7 (I believe), however I'm building with version 1.10.  Many of the examples use deprecated functionality, and as such I am deviating where needed by following django project documentation.
