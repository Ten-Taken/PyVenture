About
---------------

I'm currently teaching myself Python syntax and the django web framework. This repository will host some of
my efforts with both while getting up to speed.  Python is not a language I was exposed to in school, but has remained
a huge curiosity for me ever since using it for tool-scripting in Autodesk Maya.

programs
-----------------

In the programs directory I'm working on primarily small shell programs while familiarizing myself with the Python language
and data structures.


django_env
----------------------

In this directory I've built a complete web application using Django v1.9, Django REST, AngularJS, and SQLite3.
