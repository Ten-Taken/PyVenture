About
---------------

I'm currently teaching myself Python syntax and the django web framework. This repository will host some of the small
programs I build while getting myself up to speed with both.

Standalone
-----------------

I'm simply listing standalone programs in the root directory here:


**Guessing Game**  
	guess.py contains an IDLE / Shell program where the user guesses a random number
	between 1 and 100.

**Word Game**  
	wordGame.py is a word guessing game (similar to hangman).  The user is out after
	three strikes.


django_project
----------------------

In this directory I'm following along with a pluralsight course taught by Reindert-Jan Ekker (https://nl.linkedin.com/in/rjekker).

Django and package dependencies are set up in a virtual environment.
