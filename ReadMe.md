About
---------------

I'm currently teaching myself Python syntax. This repository will host some of the small
programs I build while getting myself up to speed with the language.  

Until the repository grows in complexity, I'll simply be listing program files here.


**Guessing Game**  
	guess.py contains an IDLE / Shell program where the user guesses a random number
	between 1 and 100.

**Word Game**  
	wordGame.py is a word guessing game (similar to hangman).  The user is out after
	three strikes.
