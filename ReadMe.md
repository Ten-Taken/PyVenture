## About  

This repository is for learning projects related to the Python language,
and the Django framework. 

programs

In the programs directory I'm working on primarily small shell programs while familiarizing myself with the Python language and data structures.

In this project (environment level) I've built a complete web application using Django v1.9, Django REST, AngularJS, and SQLite3. See the directory ReadMe for scope and purpose.

This directory hosts an example project with Django v1.11 (environment level). See the directory ReadMe for scope and purpose.
